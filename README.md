# openEO ML Showcase

Examples for ML workflows on Earth observation datacubes using the openEO client API: training, inference, and embedding-style outputs. Each use case is self-contained under its folder with Docker (and Compose where noted).

## Use cases

| Path | Summary |
|------|---------|
| [`UC1_random_forest/python`](UC1_random_forest/python) | Random Forest on Sentinel-2 L2A reflectance for crop-type classification (GeoTIFF results). Run: `docker compose up --build` from that directory. |
| [`UC1_random_forest/r`](UC1_random_forest/r) | Same UC1 graph via openEOcubes. Run: `docker compose up --build` from that directory. Test login: `brian` / `123456`. |
| [`UC2_tempcnn/r`](UC2_tempcnn/r) | TempCNN in R via `brianpondi/openeocraft`; Compose runs a local backend and the R job. Test login: `brian` / `123456`. See README for ports and Docker resource sizing. |
| [`UC3_embeddings`](UC3_embeddings) | Terramind foundation model: EO datacube → embeddings datacube (Zarr output, CPU inference). Run: `docker compose up --build` from that directory. |

Details, warnings, and exact commands live in each folder’s README.

## Requirements

Docker with Compose enabled. For UC2’s local Compose stack, the README documents test credentials (`brian` / `123456`) and how to allocate more CPU/RAM in Docker Desktop for long TempCNN jobs.
